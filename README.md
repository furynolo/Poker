Poker
=====

Freshman Poker programming assignment in C++ (with no sorting of cards).

This project demonstrates how useful sorting is and how bulky the logic gets without sorting cards (identifying "one pair" in a hand of five cards).

This assignment was also before we learned about classes which would have made the code immensely better.
